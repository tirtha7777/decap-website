title: Headless CMS

description: Traditional Content Management System architecture was once the
  standard for web development, but as business needs and customer expectations
  grow more complex, the more common technology used these days is known as
  Headless CMS, or Headless Content Management System. This page breaks down
  what Headless CMS is, including why the industry landed on “headless” as the
  chosen turn of phrase. Read on to find out more!

**What is a headless CMS?**

A headless CMS is a content management system that separates the presentation layer (where content is presented) from the backend (where content is managed). A headless CMS allows you to manage content in one place and be able to deploy that content on any digital channel you choose. Separating the frontend from the backend unlocks your content, making it easier for marketers to manage content independently, and for developers to build faster, automate changes, and manage digital at scale. In a traditional CMS, content is tangled up with code and locked in silos, making reusing content — and creating modern digital experiences — next to impossible.

**The origins of headless CMS**

To understand what a headless CMS solution is, it helps to first look at the traditional content management system and what it was designed to do. Traditional CMSes have been around since the early days of web development. Platforms like Wordpress, Drupal, and Sitecore were designed to store and present content elements like text, images, and video on websites specifically.

The traditional CMS approach to managing content puts everything into one big bucket — content, images, HTML, and CSS. This made it impossible to reuse content because it was commingled with code.

As digital channels and devices have evolved, the need for more flexible solutions has emerged. Now, enterprises are developing websites, mobile apps, digital displays, conversational interfaces, and more. Meanwhile, the traditional CMS failed to keep pace. Why? Because a CMS organizes content in webpage-oriented frameworks, making it impossible for the same content to fit other digital platforms or software.

**How does a headless CMS solution work?**

Content housed in a headless CMS is delivered via APIs for seamless display across any site, device, or other digital touchpoint. This makes content in a headless CMS endlessly reusable, no matter the omnichannel customer experience used today, or the channels that emerge in the future. This is different from Wordpress and other monolithic CMSes that tightly couple the frontend with the backend, keeping you locked into how content can (and cannot) be displayed.

Think about headless architecture and APIs like this: the main job of a headless CMS is to store and manage your content. It doesn’t really care what you want to do with that content. The main job of display platforms like a website or mobile app is to present content to people. They don’t really care how that content is stored or managed. APIs are the magical connection points that allow these backend systems (e.g., headless CMS) and frontend systems (e.g., website) to communicate in the specific ways a digital team wants them to.
