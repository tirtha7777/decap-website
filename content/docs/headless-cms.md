Traditional Content Management System architecture was once the standard for web development, but as business needs and customer expectations grow more complex, the more common technology used these days is known as Headless CMS, or Headless Content Management System. This page breaks down what Headless CMS is, including why the industry landed on “headless” as the chosen turn of phrase. Read on to find out more!

***What is a headless CMS?***

A headless CMS is a content management system that separates the presentation layer (where content is presented) from the backend (where content is managed). A headless CMS allows you to manage content in one place and be able to deploy that content on any digital channel you choose. Separating the frontend from the backend unlocks your content, making it easier for marketers to manage content independently, and for developers to build faster, automate changes, and manage digital at scale. In a traditional CMS, content is tangled up with code and locked in silos, making reusing content — and creating modern digital experiences — next to impossible.

***The origins of headless CMS***

To understand what a headless CMS solution is, it helps to first look at the traditional content management system and what it was designed to do. Traditional CMSes have been around since the early days of web development. Platforms like Wordpress, Drupal, and Sitecore were designed to store and present content elements like text, images, and video on websites specifically.



The traditionl CMS approach to managing content puts everything into one big bucket — content, images, HTML, and CSS. This made it impossible to reuse content because it was commingled with code.

As digital channels and devices have evolved, the need for more flexible solutions has emerged. Now, enterprises are developing websites, mobile apps, digital displays, conversational interfaces, and more. Meanwhile, the traditional CMS failed to keep pace. Why? Because a CMS organizes content in webpage-oriented frameworks, making it impossible for the same content to fit other digital platforms or software.
